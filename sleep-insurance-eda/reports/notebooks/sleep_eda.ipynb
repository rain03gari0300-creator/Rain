    "# Sleep Health and Lifestyle - EDA Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a lightweight summary of the exploratory data analysis for the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task**: Classification\n",
    "- **Target**: `sleep_disorder` (categorical)\n",
    "- **Features**: Demographics, sleep metrics, lifestyle factors, and blood pressure\n",
    "- **Dataset location**: `data/raw/Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps Performed\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**\n",
    "   - Standardized column names\n",
    "   - Parsed `blood_pressure` (S/D format) into `bp_systolic` and `bp_diastolic`\n",
    "   - Removed duplicates\n",
    "   - Cast categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Univariate Analysis**\n",
    "   - Histograms and boxplots for numeric features\n",
    "   - Count plots for categorical features\n",
    "   - See figures: `reports/figures/sleep_univariate_*.png`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Outlier Detection**\n",
    "   - Applied IQR method to all numeric features\n",
    "   - Removed rows with outliers beyond 1.5 * IQR\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bivariate Analysis**\n",
    "   - Boxen plots: numeric features vs. sleep_disorder\n",
    "   - Stacked bar charts: categorical features vs. sleep_disorder\n",
    "   - See figures: `reports/figures/sleep_bivariate_*.png`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "   - Spearman correlation matrix\n",
    "   - **Decision**: Dropped `bp_diastolic` if |correlation| > 0.8 with `bp_systolic` to reduce multicollinearity\n",
    "   - See figure: `reports/figures/sleep_correlation_matrix.png`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Train/Test Split**\n",
    "   - 80/20 split with stratification by `sleep_disorder` classes\n",
    "   - Ensures balanced class distributions in both sets\n",
    "   - Outputs: `data/processed/sleep_train.csv`, `data/processed/sleep_test.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blood pressure features are highly correlated; keeping only systolic pressure\n",
    "- Sleep disorders show distinct patterns across occupation, BMI category, and sleep duration\n",
    "- Gender distribution varies across sleep disorder categories\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Run\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd sleep-insurance-eda\n",
    "python src/eda_sleep.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Figures\n",
    "\n",
    "All generated figures are saved in `reports/figures/` with the prefix `sleep_`.\n"
