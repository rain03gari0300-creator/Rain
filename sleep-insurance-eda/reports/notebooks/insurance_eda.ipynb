    "# Medical Insurance Cost - EDA Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a lightweight summary of the exploratory data analysis for the Medical Insurance Cost dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task**: Regression\n",
    "- **Target**: `charges` (continuous)\n",
    "- **Features**: Age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, region\n",
    "- **Dataset location**: `data/raw/insurance.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps Performed\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**\n",
    "   - Standardized column names\n",
    "   - Cast categorical variables (sex, smoker, region)\n",
    "   - No missing values found\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Univariate Analysis**\n",
    "   - Histograms and boxplots for numeric features\n",
    "   - Count plots for categorical features\n",
    "   - See figures: `reports/figures/insurance_univariate_*.png`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Log Transformation**\n",
    "   - Created `charges_log = log1p(charges)` for modeling stability\n",
    "   - Reduces skewness in target distribution\n",
    "   - See figure: `reports/figures/insurance_log_transformation.png`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Outlier Detection**\n",
    "   - Applied IQR method only to features (age, bmi), **not** to target\n",
    "   - Preserves natural variation in insurance charges\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bivariate Analysis**\n",
    "   - Charges by smoker status (boxplot)\n",
    "   - Age vs. charges scatter plot (colored by smoker)\n",
    "   - BMI vs. charges scatter plot (colored by smoker)\n",
    "   - Charges by sex and region\n",
    "   - See figures: `reports/figures/insurance_bivariate_*.png`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "   - Spearman correlation with dummy variables\n",
    "   - **Key findings**:\n",
    "     - Region variables show low correlation with charges\n",
    "     - Children shows low correlation but may have interaction effects\n",
    "   - **Decision**: Dropped `region` to simplify model (low predictive value)\n",
    "   - See figure: `reports/figures/insurance_correlation_matrix.png`\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Train/Test Split**\n",
    "   - 80/20 split with stratification by `charges` quantiles (q=5)\n",
    "   - Ensures representative distribution of target values in both sets\n",
    "   - Outputs: `data/processed/insurance_train.csv`, `data/processed/insurance_test.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smoking status is the strongest predictor of insurance charges\n",
    "- Age and BMI show positive correlation with charges, especially for smokers\n",
    "- Region has minimal impact on charges and was removed\n",
    "- Children count has low direct correlation but may have complex interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Run\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd sleep-insurance-eda\n",
    "python src/eda_insurance.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Figures\n",
    "\n",
    "All generated figures are saved in `reports/figures/` with the prefix `insurance_`.\n"
